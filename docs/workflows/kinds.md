# Workflows kinds

In Workflows, some values cannot be defined when the Workflow Definition is created. To address this, the Execution 
Engine supports selectors, which are references to step outputs or workflow inputs. To help the Execution Engine 
understand what type of data will be provided once a reference is resolved, we use a simple type system known as 
`kinds`.

`Kinds` are used to represent the semantic meaning of the underlying data. When a step outputs data of a specific 
`kind` and another step requires input of that same `kind`, the system assumes that the data will be compatible. 
This reduces the need for extensive type-compatibility checks.

For example, we have different kinds to distinguish between predictions from `object detection` and 
`instance segmentation` models, even though representation of those `kinds` is
[`sv.Detections(...)`](https://supervision.roboflow.com/latest/detection/core/). This distinction ensures that each 
block that needs a segmentation mask clearly indicates this requirement, avoiding the need to repeatedly check 
for the presence of a mask in the input.

!!! Note

    As for now, `kinds` are such simplistic that do not support types polymorphism - and developers
    are asked to use unions of kinds to solve that problem. As defining extensive unions of kinds may be 
    problematic, this problem will probably be addressed in Execution Engine `v2`.

!!! Warning

    In `inference` release `0.18.0` we decided to make drastic move to heal the ecosystem 
    from the problem with ambiguous kinds names (`Batch[X]` vs `X` - see more 
    [here](https://github.com/roboflow/inference/issues/608)). 

    The change is breaking only if there is remote Workflow plugin depending on imports
    from `inference.core.workflows.execution_engine.entities.types` module, which is
    not the case to the best of our knowledge. We removed problematic kinds as if they
    never existed in the ecosystem and fixed all blocks from `roboflow_core` plugin.
    If there is anyone impacted by the change - here is the 
    [migration guide](https://github.com/roboflow/inference/releases/tag/v0.18.0).
